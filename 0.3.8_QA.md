Here are the highlights:

* Storage size validation (if you utilize your storage and then try to reduce size then it will message)
* Tooltip information containing name streamsapce
* Uptime percentage is sync with cli
* Rebranding change 
  1. Cacher Desktop Application-streamspace => Hive Desktop app - SWRM Labs
